# EDOS_Classification_using_Bi-LSTM
This is the course project of Natural Language Processing (CSE440 - NLP II) from BRAC University in which I solved the classification problem of Explanatory Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS).

In this NLP project we did two tasks Task A and Task B.
Task A solves the binary online sexism that is Sexism or Not Sexism whereas Task B solves 4 class classifications of EDOS i.e. Threats, Derogation, Animosity & Prejudiced Discussion. 

Here we got Accuracy and F1-score 82% for Task A and For Task B accuracy is 55% whereas F1-score is 49%.
